# README
Code that I used for my MASc at the University of Toronto from 2020 to 2022

Github has a file limit size of 100MB, so I've removed all of the `csv` files above that, and all graphs. Most of the `csv` files were raw data files, so my results should be somewhat reproduceable with the processed `csv` files.

I started this repo as an added layer of protection in case my hard drive/computer fails.
